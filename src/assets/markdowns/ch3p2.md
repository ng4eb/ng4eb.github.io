## How directives work

In Angular, **directives** are used to modify the appearance or behaviour of existing DOM elements. There are three types of directives:

1. components
2. attribute directives
3. structural directives

Components are a special extension of directives with a template for building UI blocks. Attribute and structural directives do not come with a template but are useful for attaching behavior and structural attributes to an existing component or element.

### Attribute Directives
Attribute directives are used to add behavior. For example, we can use an attribute directive such as `ngStyle` to add styles to an element dynamically.

### Structural Directives
Structural directives are used to bring structural changes to the DOM. For example, we can use the `ngIf` directive to attach or detach an element dynamically.

## Using ngIf, ngFor & ngStyle

In this section, we will use three built-in directives of Angular - `ngIf`, `ngFor` & `ngStyle`. Other built-in directives work similarly and can be looked up easily.

Let's create a new application named `built-in-directives-demo`:

```
ng new built-in-directive-demo --routing=false --style=css
```

Let's remove everything in `app.component.html` and type in the following:

```html
<p [ngStyle]="{color: 'green', fontSize: '3em'}">I am green and big because Angular says so!</p>
<p [ngStyle]="{color: 'green', 'font-size': '3em'}">Another one!</p>
<hr />
<p *ngIf="true">You can see me because ngIf is evaluated to true</p>
<p *ngIf="false">You can't see me because ngIf is evaluated to false</p>
<hr />
<p *ngFor="let fruit of ['orange', 'apple', 'banana']">
 {{fruit}}
</p>
```

### ngStyle

The attribute directive `ngStyle` is used to add dynamic styles to an element. Recall the square brackets `[]` are used for **property binding**. Under the hood, `ngStyle` attaches the `ngStyle` property to get the dynamic style values and apply them to the **host** element.

As shown above, there are two ways of writing the style values. Either use camel case for the property names like `fontSize`, or use the original format by putting them in quotes , e.g., `'font-size'`.

*We can also put the style values in the TypeScript file and reference the variable name from the template.* For example, imagine the values `"{color: 'green', fontSize: '3em'}"` come from a parent component and are stored into a variable named `someStyles`. In this case, we can use `[ngStyle]="someStyles"` to apply them.

### ngIf

`ngIf` is a structural directive that toggles the presence of an element in the DOM. For marking directives as structural, we need to prefix them with an asterisk `*` That's why we wrote `*ngIf`.

If we serve the application, we would see that the line `<p *ngIf="false">You can't see me ...</p>` is not on the page since it is not added to the DOM tree. This is because when `*ngIf` is evaluated to `false`, the **host** element is not added to the DOM.

*Usually, `ngIf` is used with a dynamic boolean value from the TypeScript file*. We can then add a way to toggle the boolean value to attach or detach the host element as we wish.

### ngFor

`ngFor` is a structural directive that allows us to loop through an array of items and generate the **host** element as many times as the number of items in the array.

The format`*ngFor="let someItem of someItems"*` is a special syntax. In `let someItem of someItems`, `someItem`  is the looped value, and `someItems`  is the array.

*We can also get the index of the current item from ngFor* by using `let i = index`, where `i` can be any name. For example, we can type in:

```html
<p *ngFor="let fruit of ['orange', 'apple', 'banana']; let i = index">
 {{i}}. {{fruit}}
</p>
```

The above will render the below numbered list on the page:

```
0. orange
1. apple
2. banana
```

Now you have already learned about three built-in directives in Angular! You can look at the full code of this section on [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ng4eb-built-in-directives-demo).

## Creating a random color directive

In this section, we will create a custom directive that applies random colors to the host elements. Before we do so, let's take a brief look at the code structure of a custom directive.

### Structure of Custom Directive
The core of a directive is the `@Directive` decorator. Below is a basic setup of a directive:

```typescript
import {Directive} from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
 selector: '[customDirective]',
})
export class CustomDirective {

}
```

The structure of `@Directive` is almost identical to `@Component`. The only difference is that `@Component` requires either the property `template` or `templateUrl`.

Like `@Component`, `@Director` has a `selector` property. Typically, we use `[someName]` for the `selector` . It is a special syntax to allow the directive to be attached as an attribute to a tag in the template.

### Hands-on

Let's create a new project called `random-color-directive-demo` using the command:

```
ng new random-color-directive-demo --routing=false --style=css
```

Now we can create a directive named `random-color` with the following command:

```
ng generate directive random-color
```

This will generate two new files in the app folder named `random-color.directive.ts` (main logic) and `random-color.directive.spec.ts` (testing) respectively.

Let's edit `random-color.directive.ts`:

```typescript
import { Directive, HostBinding } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
   selector: '[appRandomColor]'
})
export class RandomColorDirective {
   @HostBinding('style.color') get color() {
        return 'red';
   }

}
```

In the above, we added the portion:

```typescript
@HostBinding('style.color') get color() {
     return 'red';
}
```

First, the decorator `@HostBinding()` is used to retrieve a property of the **host** element. We know that an HTML element has the property `style`, which is an object that contains the property `color`. Therefore, we can target it by specifying `style.color` inside the decorator as an argument.

We typically use `@HostBinding()` with a getter function. The getter will set the value to the bound property. In the getter above, we return `'red'`. Therefore, the host element of this directive will have its `style.color` property set to `'red'`.

You can read more about **HostBinding** in [the documentation](https://angular.io/api/core/HostBinding).

For generating a random color, we can use `rgb`, which accepts three integers of range between 0 and 255. Let's change the implementation now:

```typescript
@HostBinding('style.color') get color() {
  // generate values of range 0 - 255
  const genRandom = () => Math.ceil(Math.random() * 255);
  return `rgb(${genRandom()}, ${genRandom()}, ${genRandom()})`;
}
```

Now, we can test the decorator by using it in `app.component.html`:

```html
<p appRandomColor>testing 1</p>
<p appRandomColor>testing 2</p>
<p appRandomColor>testing 3</p>
<p appRandomColor>testing 4</p>
<p appRandomColor>testing 5</p>
```

And voila! You should see some random text colors on the screen:
