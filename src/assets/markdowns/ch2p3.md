As stated in the official documentation, `angular.json` is a configuration file that is located at the root level of an Angular workspace. It provides workspace-wide and project-specific configuration defaults for build and development tools. When you use the `ng new <project-name>` command, a new workspace is automatically created as the root level of the project folder, and the command generates the `angular.json` file.

Let's now open up the `angular.json` file of the `my-first-angular-application` application (or any application generated by the Angular CLI). The file contains essential information about the application, such as the name, type, root path, and source root path.

With the `angular.json` file, you can configure your Angular CLI for a specific workspace. For example, you might want the CLI to generate SCSS files for new components in your `my-first-angular-application` project. To do this, search for the keyword schematics in the `angular.json` file and add the option as shown below:

```javascript
"schematics": {
  "@schematics/angular:component": {
    "style": "scss"
  }
}
```

After saving this, if we try to generate a new component, a `.scss` file would be created instead of a `.css` file:

You can learn more about configuring `angular.json` in [the official documentation](https://angular.io/guide/workspace-config).
