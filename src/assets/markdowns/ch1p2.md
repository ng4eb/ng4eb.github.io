## Advantages of Angular

### Type Safety

Angular uses TypeScript for type safety, which results in more maintainable code and prevention of many runtime errors that could occur in JavaScript.

### Powerful CLI

Angular has a powerful CLI that simplifies project creation, code generation, and feature addition.

### Performance

Angular's [Ivy compiler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anphffaCZrQ) utilizes [incremental DOM](http://google.github.io/incremental-dom/), which efficiently updates DOM trees. This results in low memory usage and high performance of web applications built with Angular.

### Reactive Programming

Angular embraces RxJS, a library for reactive programming using observables. RxJS simplifies complex asynchronous code.

### Robust Structure

Angular utilizes classes to create modules, components, and services, and uses the dependency injection technique to make classes independent of their dependencies. This makes Angular components more reusable. Angular also separates TypeScript (logic), CSS (styling), and HTML (template) into different files, making the project more maintainable.

Additionally, Angular comes with the [Jasmine test framework](https://jasmine.github.io/) for easy application testing.

### Excellent Documentation

Angular has up-to-date, comprehensive [documentation](https://angular.io/)  that covers almost everything about Angular, making it easy for developers to look up features.

### Broad Community

Angular has a large community of developers, making it easy to find answers to questions about Angular.

## Angular compared to other options

### Angular vs React
[React](https://github.com/facebook/react)  is a UI library developed by Facebook that uses JSX and functional programming. It uses [JSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSX_(JavaScript)) and embraces [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming). React has a huge ecosystem powered by its community. Also, React uses the [Virtual DOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html), resulting in fast performance.

React is easier to learn for simple applications, but building a large application with React requires a solid understanding of its ecosystem.

Angular, on the other hand, is a framework that does not use JSX, instead using HTML with directives for templates. Angular includes more tools such as TypeScript and RxJS, making it harder to learn but more powerful for large applications.

### Angular vs Vue
[Vue](https://vuejs.org/) is a framework created by Evan You, an ex-Google employee.  Like React, Vue utilizes the Virtual DOM and allows developers to write in both JSX and HTML templates.

Vue is easy to learn and flexible, but this flexibility requires time to learn best practices for writing well-structured code.
