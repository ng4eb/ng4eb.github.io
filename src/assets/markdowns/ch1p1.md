## Angular: A Comprehensive Front-end Framework for SPAs

Angular is a front-end framework for building [single page applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) (SPAs).

Angular is an all-encompassing front-end framework that enables the creation of single page applications (SPAs). Developed by Google, Angular was first introduced in 2016 as a complete overhaul of Angular.js.

Unlike a library, Angular is a framework that is opinionated, meaning that it provides a pre-defined structure for building applications.

Angular embraces [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which provides robust type-checking and enhances the application's reliability. Additionally, Angular utilizes [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection), which enables efficient code management, and [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/), a powerful library for reactive programming.

As an Angular developer, it is essential to have a strong understanding of these tools to achieve optimal productivity.
