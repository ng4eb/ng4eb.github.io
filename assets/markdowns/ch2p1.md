## Prerequisites

Before installing Angular, you must have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine.

You can download and install them by following the instructions on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). It is recommended to install the LTS version of Node.js.

To check if Node.js and npm have been successfully installed, run the following two commands in a terminal:

```
node -v
```

```
npm -v
```

These commands will return the version of Node.js and npm installed on your machine. If either command produces an error, it means that the corresponding programme is not installed properly.

## Installing Angular

Once Node.js and npm are installed, you can install Angular using the following command in a terminal:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
```

This command will install the latest version of Angular CLI on your machine. Note that you can use the same command to upgrade the Angular CLI if a newer version is available.

### Verifying the Installation

To verify the installation of Angular CLI, run `ng --version` in a terminal. This command will display information about the Angular CLI installation, including the current version.
